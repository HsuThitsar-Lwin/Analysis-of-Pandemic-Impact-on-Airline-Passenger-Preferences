# Analysis-of-Pandemic-Impact-on-Airline-Passenger-Preferences
## Project Overview
This project explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted passenger preferences in the commercial aviation industry. Through a combination of **time series analysis**, **sentiment analysis**, and several **machine learning models**, we investigate how customer expectations have evolved pre- and post-pandemic. The goal is to provide insights for airlines to enhance their services, better meet customer demands, and improve profitability.

## Key Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: To track and compare sentiment trends and key factors influencing customer experience across pre- and post-COVID periods.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews and understand the main drivers behind passenger satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - Clustering

## Motivation
The aviation industry relies heavily on customer feedback to improve service and enhance the overall travel experience. With changing travel norms due to COVID-19, understanding passenger preferences is crucial for airlines to adapt. This project aims to help airlines discover which changes in customer preferences are transient versus more permanent, providing actionable insights for long-term strategy.

## Data and Methods
The dataset used is an open-source dataset collected by Airline Equality via Kaggle consisting of flight reviews and itineraries between the year of 2012 to 2023 (Vyshnia G, 2023). We performed:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment analysis and feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models to predict and classify sentiment, as well as identify trends.

## Results
This project uncovers critical insights regarding the changing expectations of passengers, such as increased concerns around health and safety, flexibility in bookings, and overall service quality. The machine learning models provide predictive insights that airlines can use to adjust marketing and operational strategies to align with evolving customer needs.

## Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive view of how the pandemic has altered passenger preferences, enabling airlines to make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing industry.
